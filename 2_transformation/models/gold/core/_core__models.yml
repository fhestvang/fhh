      # Customer Dimension Table

      ## Overview
      Comprehensive customer dimension with demographic attributes,
      order metrics, and customer segmentation.

      ## Grain
      One row per customer (Type 2 SCD ready)

      ## Business Logic
      - Aggregates customer lifetime metrics
      - Calculates RFM-style segmentation
      - Includes SCD Type 2 scaffolding for future use

      ## Refresh Schedule
      - **Full refresh**: Daily at 2 AM UTC
      - **Incremental**: Not applicable (full refresh only)

      # Orders Fact Table

      ## Overview
      Core fact table for order transactions with grain of one row per order.
      Contains foreign keys to dimensions and order-level metrics.

      ## Grain
      One row per order

      ## Business Logic
      - Aggregates all payments at order level
      - Pivots payment methods for analysis
      - Includes order status flags
      - Uses intermediate layer for payment aggregation

      ## Refresh Schedule
